SUMMARY:
--------------------
CSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access ensures fewer collisions. if station A wants to send data, it will first sense the medium. however, by the time the first bit of data is transmitted from station A, it will also find it idle and will also send data. this will result in collision of data from station A and CSMA CSMA Access Modes. the node senses the channel, if idle it sends the data, otherwise it checks the medium after a random amount of . CSMA. 'i.. 'it. 'it. 'it. it. if station B wants to send data it will send 'disad if it finds the. it will also if it is 'delated due to propagation.. CSMA CSMA CSMA
