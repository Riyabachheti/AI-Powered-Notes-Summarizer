SUMMARY:
--------------------
CSMA
Carrier Sense Multiple Access ensures fewer collisions as the station is required to first sense the medium (for idle or busy) before transmitting data.  If it is idle then it sends data, otherwise it waits till the channel becomes idle.  However there is still chance of collision in CSMA due to propagation delay...
