Artificial Intelligence is transforming healthcare through innovative applications in diagnostic imaging, personalized medicine, and drug discovery. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images with remarkable accuracy, often detecting abnormalities missed by human radiologists. AI-powered diagnostic tools are particularly valuable in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals. Personalized medicine uses AI to analyze genetic data and predict individual patient responses to treatments. Drug discovery is being accelerated through AI applications that identify potential compounds and optimize clinical trials. However, challenges include data privacy concerns and ensuring AI systems are transparent and unbiased.
